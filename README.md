Home Price Prediction Project
=============================

Overview
--------

This project aims to predict the prices of residential homes using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other factors, we can develop models to estimate the price of a house accurately.

Dataset
-------

The dataset used in this project is sourced from \[kaggle]. It contains information about residential properties including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and sale price.

Project Structure
-----------------

*   `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
*   `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
*   `models/`: Trained machine learning models saved for future use.
*   `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
*   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the project.

Usage
-----

1.  Preprocess the data: Use scripts in `src/preprocessing/` to clean and preprocess the dataset.
2.  Train models: Utilize scripts in `src/models/` to train machine learning models using preprocessed data.
3.  Evaluate models: Evaluate the performance of trained models using scripts in `src/evaluation/`.
4.  Make predictions: Once satisfied with the model performance, use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
